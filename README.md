# Sorting_Methods

Code for 7 distinct sorting algorithms: selection, bubble, bogo, insertion, count, cocktail, and merge. The program asks the user for how many numbers to sort, then generating an array of random numbers between 1 and the number given. The user than picks the sorting method and the program outputs the sorted array and the time it took to sort.

This was done for a project in grade 12 computer science.
